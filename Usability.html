    <h1>Usability</h1>
    <div>
      <h4>Layout of Website</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I included the use of buttons to make navigation easier. I feel like this makes it better organized.</li>
        <li>In the future I would consider changing the positioning of the buttons along with the color.</li>
        <li>I would also change the background of the website in the future.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h4>Images</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>On my homepage I went with as picture of myself so that people can see what I look like. In the future I would add more pictures.</li>
         
      </ul>
      <h4>Future of Website</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>In the future I would like to clean up my coding so that it looks neat. As I gain more knowledge, I will enhance my website with better features to make my website look cooler and smoother.</li>
